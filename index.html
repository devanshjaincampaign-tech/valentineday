                <div id="paragraph"><p>
                    Met a girl, in the Entente MUN, where we had an eye contact of just a second but then here we are today, cant even take eyes off each other. OO how can I even forget love, your head on Manya's shoulder, a big wide smile, eyes on me, just in her own delusional world but at the end its no more a delusion, its the reality. The reality of us being together even after all highs and lows. The reality of us being mad for eachother, the reality that we cant ignore. something that tell us to be togetherr forever, to end this as married couple and to stay with each other till the last breath.<br>
                    You were true when you said that i will be the sunshine of your life that evening, breaking down infront of you was the only option I had and i just said it. I know that you were hurt then but you still chose to handle me, what else i needed to understand about how much you loved me. And obviously you still love me like no one else. you know things that no one knows not even my family. But you are my family now, the family with whom i can stay forever.<br>
                    So yes it is true that you are the one with whom i feel relaxed, i feel calm and composed. i wanna spend every second of my life with you no matter what it takes of me. there are alot of things that i just say everytime i write a paragraph and i know they sound repeated but it is also true that those are the things that i want to tell you every now and then and i want you to know how important you are to me. 
                    <br>
                    I just want you to know one thing love that you are the most important part of my life now and that i dont wanna loose you ever, i wanna be with you i wanna stay with you, i need your love care kindness and everthing because you are mine those things are mine and bs mere ho to mere he rhoge muahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.......<br>
                    I always say it and i will say it again anyways, that you are the sukoon that i want in my life forever, you provide me the safe shelter, you provvide the love and care that no onn else has, you provide me the safe space the feeling of home which makes me feel comfortable andd i can open to you like anything. Your presence matters so much that when you are not there everything is messed up and when you just show up or your text comes everything is suddenly so fine, a smile comes on my face and i get to know that yes everything is going to be fine. thats all because of you. You are just so precious in my life that even your inlaws know that she is gonna keep him safe and secured. that is why even they love you so much, you have a very specific place in my heart...or i should say that my heart is what belongs to you and there is nothing else apart from you that can ever be in my heart..(boobies bhi heheheheheh..aur ass bhi hehehehe aur aur navel bhi heheheheh).<br>
                    Words will be so less to express what i actually feel for you....
                    So Ms. Vishakha mishra jii, would you like to become mrs jain and spend the whole life with me fighting loving caring snuggling kissing hugging and obv fuckinggg...will you be my valentine love.....i love you so much vishuuu....
