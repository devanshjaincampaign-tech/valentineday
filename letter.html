                This letter is to the Girl whom I love the most, to the one whp is still with me ever after the mistakes that i have made, and ik that if anyone else would be at your place, she would have surely left me. But why to talk about someone else, when i have YOU. YOU are not just a part of my life but a necessity, a habit, a everyday thing. YOU are the one with whome I share every bit of my life, without thinking twice because ik you will never judge me. YOU are the one who makes me feel safe, safe like home, where ik that i can live the way i want like a kid, like someone who is taken care of forever. YOU actually are the sunshine of my life, entered into my life with just a reply of note and then now staying with me becoming the most important note that i always read. YOU are mine forever, call it being selfish, call it whatever you want to, but you are just mine and i am going to keep you with me no matter what you say. YES, ik i act stupid sometimes, not just sometimes but most of the times, but i can also assure you that the way I love you, no one else can becuase I love you from the depth of my heart andd my heart belongs to you, infact you are my heart....AAP SAMAJH RHE HO NA WHAT I AM SAYING.<br>
                we have come so far, although we have more than this to go far. but yes we have come so far, we have hd out first fight, we have had our so called first sex, although we still are virgin hahaha...we have had our so ccalled first baby "CONGRATULATION YOU ARE A FATHER". We have even had out first kiss OMG okie so i am gonna talk about it (hehehe). I Didnt know it was going to happen, for me i just thought i will just stay by your side and just may be hug you and be with you that is it, but then we were alone in the room, it was you and me, you came onto me and i hugged you i could feel you, I could feel that skin and then when you weere on my lap, we were so close and then we actually kissed, ff that was the moment i can never take out of my head because at that moment of time everything that i had in my mind I forgot about it. That kiss that actually lasted long, That kiss just melted me in such a way that no otheer kiss could. that was yes the best kiss because we didnt have anything to be worried about, so at the end it was just us kissing and melting into eachother without thinking about anything else. urghhhh i can still feel it while typing all this onto this screen and i am pretty sure that you will be smiling while reading it. 
                <br>
                TO THE ONE, I LOVE THE MOST, IT IS YOU, OBVIOUSLY. I LOVE YOU MOST AND I WANT TO SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE WITH YOU. YOU ARE NOT JUST THE IMPORTANT PART OF MY LIFE, BUT ALSO THE ONLY IMPORTANT PART OF MY LIFE. YES I WANT IT TO LAST FOREVER, YES I WANT IT TO BE MY LAST, MY FOREVER, AND IK LADTE JHAGADTE WE WILL TAKE IT TO THE END, TILL OUR LAST BREATH<br>
                SO VISHU...I LOVE YOU SO MUCHH....
